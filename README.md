# practicejs: 

I created this project to practice Vue.js. 

NPM dependencies installed: 

vue router: to crearte a SPA, 
vuex: to move my datas and state in the store.js,
vue axios: to make my get and post http requests.
vee validate: to validate my input form.


For mere learning purposes, I tried to crete a mini server with node.js and express. 

To get pre-styled comonents I installed bootstrap.vue ( i.e: modals, carousel, few buttons) and Vee spinner(to get my loader).
